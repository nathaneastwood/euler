We follow the style guide maintained within the [tidyverse](http://style.tidyverse.org). This is tested using the [`lintr`](https://github.com/jimhester/lintr) package; you can automatically conform your code to these standards using the [`styler`](https://github.com/r-lib/styler) package.

We follow the commit message style guide maintained within the [angular.js](https://github.com/angular/angular.js/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#commit) project.

The start of commit messages must be one of the following:

* **feat**: A new feature
* **fix**: A bug fix
* **doc**: Documentation only changes
* **style**: Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code (white-space,
formatting, missing semi-colons, etc)
* **refactor**: A code change that neither fixes a bug or adds a feature
